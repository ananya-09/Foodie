# Authentication Setup Guide

## Backend Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the `backend` directory with the following variables:

```env
# JWT Secret for authentication
JWT_SECRET=your-super-secret-jwt-key-change-this-in-production

# MongoDB connection string
MONGODB_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/foodie-app

# Node environment
NODE_ENV=development
```

## Fixed Issues

### 1. Backend Response Format
- Added `success: true` field to authentication responses
- Both login and registration now return consistent response format

### 2. Token Management
- Backend uses HTTP-only cookies for secure token storage
- Frontend stores user info in localStorage and auth flag
- Proper logout clears both cookie and localStorage

### 3. Authentication State Management
- App.jsx properly tracks authentication state
- Navbar updates user display when login/logout occurs
- LoginPopup updates parent authentication state

### 4. Redirection After Login
- Users are redirected to home page (`/`) after successful login
- Page reloads to update all components with new auth state

## How Authentication Works

1. **Sign Up/Login**: User submits form in LoginPopup
2. **Backend**: Validates credentials and sets HTTP-only cookie
3. **Frontend**: Stores user info in localStorage and sets auth flag
4. **State Update**: All components update to reflect logged-in state
5. **Navigation**: User is redirected to home page

## Testing the Authentication

1. Start the backend server: `cd backend && npm start`
2. Start the frontend: `cd frontend && npm run dev`
3. Click "Sign In" button in the navbar
4. Try both "Sign Up" and "Login" flows
5. Verify user is redirected to home page after successful authentication
6. Verify user info appears in navbar after login
7. Test logout functionality

## Security Features

- HTTP-only cookies prevent XSS attacks
- SameSite=strict prevents CSRF attacks
- Passwords are hashed with bcrypt
- JWT tokens expire after 7 days
- Secure cookie settings for production
